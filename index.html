                Hi! I’m Nishta, a 22 year old wanting to make a meaningful impact in this world. 
                I’m fascinated by the power technology. With my logical skills and problem solving mindset, 
                I believe that I could contribute significantly to this field.<br> 
                <br>

                Ofcourse at this point you’re thinking, this is exactly like every other portfolio or cover letter.<br>
                But i need to show you that I not only stand out, I also fit in the perfect amount.<br>
                I’m a great collaborator, but I’m also a leader in my team.<br>
                I am careful and do my research thoroughly, but I also love to take risks and learn on the go.<br>
                I put a 100% of my effort into my work, but I value work-life balance and give my hobbies enough time.<br>
                Phew! It’s really hard trying to be the perfect candidate!<br>
                <br>

                So I made this website not to impress, not to show off, but to create an honest 
                representation of who I am. This website contains my skills, my experiences, and my learnings. 
                Through this webpage, you can learn about the real Nishta Krishnan. 
                And if that’s not enough of a reason to keep reading, I spent 2 months working on this so it 
                deserves a quick scroll at least!

                      I joined UIUC as a math major because of my love for the subject and was fascinated by how deeply the world relies on math. Over time, I realized I wanted to pursue an applied field of mathematics. I discovered that the logical thinking and problem-solving skills in computer science perfectly complemented my mathematical mindset, motivating me to switch to a Math + CS degree. Through courses like combinatorics, real analysis, system development, and computer architecture, I was challenged to think critically. Working on projects taught me how to build from scratch, and channel my passion for math and technology into meaningful contributions. Through these challenging courses and projects, I built a strong foundation in math and computer science, preparing me to solve real-world problems with logic and creativity, embracing mistakes along the way.<br/> <br/>  
                      College life wasn’t just about academics for me. I was actively involved in two organizations: Illini Awaaz, a South Asian A Cappella group, and MATRIX, the Math Association. Being part of these groups allowed me to connect with like-minded people and provided me with some great friends. Outside of this, I made it a point to enjoy college traditions, attending plenty of football and basketball games—I’ve always loved sports, and it gave me a great work-life balance. I also fueled my love for trying new things by taking classes like ice skating, volleyball, and theater, which helped me enjoy a well-rounded college experience.<br/> <br/>  
                      My college journey has been one of the most transformative chapters of my life. Leaving India for the States wasn’t just about stepping out of my home—it meant being across the world from my close family and friends. Adjusting to a new culture and lifestyle was challenging at first, but it pushed me to grow. I learned to take responsibility for things I once took for granted, like cooking, cleaning, and managing finances. These experiences taught me how to adapt and take charge of my own life.<br/> <br/>

                        I was privileged to spend 12 enriching years as a student at The Valley School in Bangalore, India, set on 100 acres of forest land. The school is inspired by the teachings of philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti. Its unique approach to education goes beyond academics, focusing on qualities like introspection, sensitivity, and a deep connection with nature. The Valley School’s emphasis on holistic development ensures that students not only gain knowledge but also learn ways to apply their knowledge effectively in life.<br/> <br/>  
                        The Valley School nurtured my sense of curiosity by providing me with an environment where questioning was encouraged, and judgment was absent. Close student-teacher relationships played a pivotal role in breaking down barriers, allowing me to approach teachers without fear and explore the deeper reasons behind why we study what we study. Learning amidst nature further enriched my education, enabling me to recognize patterns and make meaningful connections between classroom lessons and the world around me. My love for technology stems from this foundation of exploration, as I was encouraged to see the interplay between ideas and their applications in real life.<br/> <br/>  
                        After hearing about the philosophy of The Valley School, many are impressed by the holistic learning it provides but mistakenly believe that there isn't enough focus on academics. This is far from true. The school is affiliated with the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) and integrates its unique teaching philosophy into this syllabus. This curriculum required students to select three main subjects, and I chose Physics, Chemistry, and Math. English was a common subject for all. I scored a 96% average in my 12th-grade finals, a feat I credit to the school’s approach, which helped me truly understand and make the best use of what I learned.<br/> <br/>  
                        Beyond academics, I was an active member of the school volleyball team. Our team participated in various tournaments, fostering teamwork and resilience, further enriching my overall experience at The Valley School.<br/> <br/>
