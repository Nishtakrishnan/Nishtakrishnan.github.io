                This website is a representation of who I am — a place where I get to share the experiences, challenges, and lessons that have shaped me into the person I am today. Before you jump to conclusions and think this is just a prettier version of my resume, let me assure you: it’s much more than that. I created this space because I believe there’s so much more to me than the typical bullet points on a resume that make every one of us seem like tech geniuses saving the world. This is where you’ll get to know the real Nishta Krishnan.<br><br>
                I designed and built this site on my own (with a little help from ChatGPT, of course). I took it on as a personal project after graduating college, not only to apply my front-end development skills but also to create something that reflects key moments and achievements in my life — a space I can continue to update. It took several months to bring this to life, and honestly, it's still a work in progress. There will always be something new to add — new experiences, new lessons, and new ways I grow.<br><br>
                So, take your time and have fun exploring. I’m excited to share this with you!

                      <!-- Additional content goes here -->
                      I joined UIUC as a math major because of my love for the subject and was fascinated by how deeply the world relies on math. Over time, I realized I wanted to pursue an applied field of mathematics. I discovered that the logical thinking and problem-solving skills in computer science perfectly complemented my mathematical mindset, motivating me to switch to a Math + CS degree. Through courses like combinatorics, real analysis, system development, and computer architecture, I was challenged to think critically. Working on projects taught me how to build from scratch, and channel my passion for math and technology into meaningful contributions. Through these challenging courses and projects, I built a strong foundation in math and computer science, preparing me to solve real-world problems with logic and creativity, embracing mistakes along the way.<br/> <br/>  
                      College life wasn’t just about academics for me. I was actively involved in two organizations: Illini Awaaz, a South Asian A Cappella group, and MATRIX, the Math Association. Being part of these groups allowed me to connect with like-minded people and provided me with some great friends. Outside of this, I made it a point to enjoy college traditions, attending plenty of football and basketball games—I’ve always loved sports, and it gave me a great work-life balance. I also fueled my love for trying new things by taking classes like ice skating, volleyball, and theater, which helped me enjoy a well-rounded college experience.<br/> <br/>  
                      My college journey has been one of the most transformative chapters of my life. Leaving India for the States wasn’t just about stepping out of my home—it meant being across the world from my close family and friends. Adjusting to a new culture and lifestyle was challenging at first, but it pushed me to grow. I learned to take responsibility for things I once took for granted, like cooking, cleaning, and managing finances. These experiences taught me how to adapt and take charge of my own life.<br/> <br/>

                        I spent 12 enriching years as a student at The Valley School in Bangalore, India, set on 100 acres of forest land. Inspired by philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti, the school emphasizes not only academics but also introspection, sensitivity, and a deep connection with nature. This holistic approach ensures students gain knowledge and learn to apply it effectively in life.<br/> <br/>  
                        The Valley School fostered my curiosity in an environment where questioning was encouraged and judgment was absent. Close student-teacher relationships allowed me to explore the deeper reasons behind what we study, while learning amidst nature helped me make connections between classroom lessons and the world around me. My love for technology grew from this foundation, where I saw the link between ideas and their real-life applications.<br/> <br/>  
                        While many admire the school’s philosophy, some mistakenly believe it lacks academic focus. This isn’t true. Affiliated with the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), the school integrates its philosophy with the syllabus. I chose Physics, Chemistry, and Math as my main subjects, along with English, and scored a 96% average in my 12th-grade finals—thanks to the school’s approach to learning.<br/> <br/>  
                        In addition to academics, I was an active member of the volleyball team, participating in various tournaments that built teamwork and resilience, further enriching my experience.<br/> <br/>
